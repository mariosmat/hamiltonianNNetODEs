There are two python codes that include Hamiltonian neural networks used for solving differential equations that govern the spatio-temporal motion of a dynamical system. Two particular examples are presented by those codes. The nonlinear oscillator and the chaotic Henon-Heiles dynamical system. For comparison, a Scipy solver is used and its solutions are considered as the ground truth. In addition, an Euler symplectic integrator is used. The solutions obtained by the Hamiltonian neural network out-performs the solutions obtained by the symplectic Euler.  After running the python codes figures will pop up to present the results.
