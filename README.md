# hamiltonian_networks
The two python codes include Hamiltonian networks used for solving differential equations that govern the spatio-temporal motion of a dynamical system. Two particular examples are presented by those codes, the nonlinear oscillator and the chaotic Henon-Heiles dynamical system. For comparison, a SciPy solver is used and its solutions are considered as the ground truth.
In addition, an Euler symplectic integrator is used. 
The solutions obtained by the Hamiltonian network out-performs them obtained by the symplectic Euler. 
You need just to run the python codes and figures will pop out to present the results.
